- 👋 Hi, I’m @marebearexe
- 👀 I’m interested in birds, mostly
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how the fuck coding works. I am so lost y'all
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing until I can make my tiny brain squirt out a vague understanding of this shit
- 📫 How to reach me: don't.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/he, take your pick I do not care.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a sleep disorder. Not so fun, actually.
